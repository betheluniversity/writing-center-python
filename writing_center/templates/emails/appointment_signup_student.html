    <h3>Additional Information:</h3>
        <p>For our online Writing Center appointments, we will be using Google Docs and Google Hangouts Meet.</p>
        <h4>Google Docs</h4>
            <p>Five minutes before the start of your appointment, please <strong>Share</strong> your Google Doc with
                your tutor. Make sure they have permission to <strong>Edit</strong> the document.</p>
        <h4>Google Hangouts Meet</h4>
            <p>Your writing center tutor will invite you to a Google Hangouts Meet appointment; you will receive this
                invitation via your e-mail account (or it can be done through your Google calendar).</p>
            <p>Please follow these steps to connect with them:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click on the email from your tutor that begins with "Invitation: Your name @time/date of
                        appointment..."</li>
                    <li>Once the email has opened, it will show the appointment scheduled. Click on the blue highlighted
                        url link under the "Join Hangouts Meet" if you can join via your laptop.  Otherwise, there is a
                        highlighted phone number link for phone calls.</li>
                    <li>A Meet window should pop up of a video running of yourself and a green button that says, "Join
                        Now." Go ahead and click that button and then click again the "Join Now" button to start the
                        virtual appointment. Please start this process 5 minutes before your appointed time to make sure
                        your connection and equipment are all working. Also, make sure video and audio are on (or
                        whatever your preferences are).</li>
                </ol>
            <p>See <a href="https://confluence.bethel.edu/display/ITSKB/Using+Google+Hangouts+Meet">
